#RGBA hq2x
[hq2x](http://web.archive.org/web/20070624082212/www.hiend3d.com/hq2x.html) with Windows dependency removed and updated to support full RGBA without intermediate conversion to 16-bit color. It's based on `ASM`-less version.

##TODO

* Comparison algorithm compares alpha as regular channel. Accurate comparison should probably be more sophisticated than that.
* Merge with [another version of the code](http://code.google.com/p/hqx/) (especially for support of more formats than TGA).
